🍦 About Sweet Scoops

Welcome to <b>Sweet Scoops</b>  "where every click brings a sprinkle of sweetness to your screen!"  

I’m Kinza Tanweer, a passionate student of 
  <b>Gujrat University, Main Campus</b>,
and this website is more than just a project – it’s a dream dipped in creativity and topped with a whole lot of heart.  

Sweet Scoops started as a university assignment, but quickly turned into a fun and flavorful journey. Whether it's mouth-watering treats, creative dessert ideas, or a sweet twist on student life, this site is a little taste of joy for everyone.

👩‍💻 A Little About Me – Kinza Tanweer
</mark>
I’m currently pursuing my studies at Gujrat University, and I created Sweet Scoops as part of an academic project – but it’s become something I truly love working on. I enjoy combining design, storytelling, and technology to create experiences that people enjoy.  

When I’m not busy with code or classes, you’ll probably find me daydreaming about chocolate chip cookies, exploring new design trends, or learning something new in tech.
